A.- Requirements

To build on macOS you need Xcode 12 or 13 (get it from the App store or the
Apple developer site) and therefore macOS Catalina for Xcode 12 or Big Sur
for Xcode 13 (the target system/SDK is set by the viewer build scripts to
v10.12, so the resulting viewer binary should nonetheless be compatible with
macOS Sierra or newer Mac systems).
When building with Xcode 13 you get some more link-time warnings due to a few
badly targetted libraries built by Linden Lab; these are harmless.

You additionally need Python and CMake. You may install both using macports
(https://ports.macports.org/).

Alternatively (but untested by me) you may install Python from a macOS PKG
downloaded from the official Python site (https://www.python.org/). Do make
sure the 'python' executable path is added to your PATH environment variable.

You may also install CMake with the DMG downloaded from the official CMake site
(https://cmake.org/download/). IMPORTANT: cmake v3.12.0 is the *minimum* cmake
version required for buidling with Xcode 10 or newer. CMake v3.16+ is
recommended for a faster compilation. Also make sure to run:
sudo "/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake-gui" --install
in order to get the command line cmake to be properly installed.


To verify that all the required components are available on your system, open a
new terminal (i.e. do not use the one you installed from) and type:
xcodebuild -version
python --version
cmake --version


B.- Building

To build a viewer release (x86, 64 bits only) from the sources:

1.- Extract the viewer sources from the tarball.
2.- Open a terminal.
3.- Change to the linden/ directory.
4.- Type (*): ./macos-build.sh
5.- Cross your fingers...

With some luck (did you properly cross your fingers ?), you should find the
resulting, ready to run "Cool VL Viewer.app" in the following directory:
linden/build-darwin-x86_64/

(*) Or, to build a RelWithDebInfo viewer binary: ./macos-build.sh -s
	And for a Debug build: ./macos-build.sh -d
