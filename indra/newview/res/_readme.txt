The *.cur, *.ico and *.BMP files distributed in this folder with the source
tree are just empty files: they get overwriten when the artwork package is
extracted during the building process.
Those fake files are just here to make cmake happy while running the develop.py
script under Windows to configure the build (i.e. before the artwork package is
downloaded and extracted).
